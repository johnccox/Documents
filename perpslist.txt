peter wilberg, connected with gara.  calls himself the most original and subversive thinker in the 21st century.  involved in non-medical medicine, has this cultish alternative kind of thing.  so it's like devotional, belief kind of control thing maybe? and like gara, throws in quantum physics. read the extract from his book, reflections on sexuality.

>>in european culture, "romantic" love restored dimension of both spirituality and/or human warmthe and affection to sexual relations, and yet it also lacked the second axis of sexuality - the parental or age axis - which, not being recognised or affirmed, could then only find distorted expression in abusive paedophilia.  i say abusive paedophilia - for the word'paedophilia' as such simply means 'love of children'.  this of course a 'loaded' subject.  for the so-called 'universal taboo' on 'incest' in all forms and in its most general sense - sexual relations between 'minors' and adults (including older brothers, uncles, other adults, parents and priests) far from being a 'taboo', has been and still is a normative part of many if not most cultures - not least indian culture - and that even at the time of Abhinavagupta (where it is affirmed in the Tantraloka itself).
even in the modern west however, such well-known sex researchers as kinsey and pomeroy 'transgressively' announced that they saw nothing wrong with consensual, mutually pleasurable sex with minors.  here too ther are questions that have remained hidden and unaddressed, and that have nothing to do with simply accepting or rejecting such positions.  this is because most culturally normative, non-commercial sex with minors, is in reality, non-consensual and abusive - again and not least in India, but also in many other cultures.  one key question to be considered therefore is when and why did this almost universal form of sexual 'transgression' begin - and when and why didit take on its now generally abusive and non-consensual form?

for its result today is an obsession with 'age of consent', together with a generalised taboo, at least in western cultures, on sexual relations between people of different age groups - and an ever more paranoid blurring of the boundaries between sexual and non-sexual expressions of adult love and affection for children.

this blurring comes, i believe from a failure to recognise that what i have termed 'the second axis of sexuality', which does indeed have and erotic and sensual dimension, and yet one quite distinct from genital sexuality.  this is both a pre- and sub-genital dimension of human eroticism, one aroused by whole body contact of a sort which generates a sense of being held and embraced by a 'larger' body, or else is rooted in lower 'chakras' than those associated with genital sexuality.  it is also the counterpart to a 'trans-genital' form of tantric eroticism.  this arises through a tangible, bodily sense of being held within the embrace of 'god' or the divine - sensually touched and penetrated by the all-surrounding and all-pervasive awareness that it most essentially is.

rod lloyd, from melbourne, this guy looks so creepy, describes gara as his oldest friend or closest.
http://acharyacorrrespondence1.blogspot.com/

professor kalucy.  up at flinders, just the manner of this man, and then how he's held in awe, like THEY are.  but he's all mental health, but then i found an article on women and alcohol abuse.  like he was right into that, not in a psychiatric sense, just buying into it.

ian dunn, my friend's father.  came to adelaide from victoria.  what was his background, business i think.  worked as a consultant for department of health.  trips to the philipines as a consultant there too.  i remember he had this thing about collecting model aeroplanes.  like ones that actually fly or something.  like he wasn't ever seeming to be interested in them, just they were there.  like toys for children just in his study.  the tragedy, my friend's mother committed suicide.  it was strange, but now i see, there was something not right.  no really, i saw it ages ago, and it kills me, he's my closest friend this guy, and his mum topped herself, i don't think he knows why, but i see it was down to his father.  so it's weird with this perp, his father, like he's creepy for sure, but it needs to be discreet, understand, i don't want it seen that this one being down to me, cause that would mess up my friendship, i have few friends these days the way things have been turned against me

rob childs, he worked in disability funding, ran this thing called scala, but so much, like i watched this guy for a long time, even he's got daughters, but him leering at these young female musicians in his rotten scala thing.  his wife's a nurse too, and i'm not sure if she's in on it.  like with these perps.  have you checked out the meaningofdepression web site by marianne brough.  like she's giving credit to gara and wilberg.  does she know what she's doing, can't she tell?

rob transini.  not sure about this guy.  came across him through rob childs.  similarly, going for young girls, so he's these two aren't paedo strict, which is young boys for pure sadism.  they appear to be just sexually inappropriate, immature kinds, like going for underage girls, dirty old man style.  more transini is that, childs, he's creepier.

david penberthy
grew up in adelaide, began studying law, but changed.
then a journalist, a year in mexico?
but now he's the editor of the online, the punch, noted for it's faux debate over who is more domestically violent, men or women.
and then he boasts close associations with michael flood, speaks very highly of him.
i know the media is infiltrated and poisoned, this man is part of it.

mskittie30, i like what you're getting at because it's good to have active debate but frankly, you really could get in there and give it to them.  that man made climate change by various means was last reported in 1871 and that was funny: http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1298497.
the greens came from a combination of nazis and communists.  that putting these prices on CO2 means rich people get solar panels and hybrid cars.  poor people get colder and are crushed.  it's called keynesian economics named after the reputed fabian by the name of john maynard keynes interestingly noted that he came out as a paedophile, 11 year old castratoes was his thing.  democracy is not representative anyway but with the internet people are getting wise and so now the powers that be are turning up the heat.  gorbachev said it that the myth of climate catastrophe would be the key to unlocking the new world order.  and all those scientists with their bottles of egg, how they sailed down to antarctica a while back to observe the ice melts, only despite being able to predict the weather for the next couple of hundred years, they couldn't quite get it right for the next 2 weeks.  cause where there was scientifically proven and established beyond adoubt, peer reviewed proof to substantiate the claims, only that wasn't quite right when a ship of climate specialised scientist got stuck in ice flows that they couldn't get out of, that their sad, introspective wanna be lives were endangered and at great taxpayer expense they had to be rescued.
if you ask me, from cfc to ozone, from co2 to greenhouse only the last effort was a subatomic process of co2 infusing heat back into the atmosphere only it's not quite so hot as it used to be, now it's going to be tropical anyway, with the increased evaporation and aqua cycle, it's going to be tough going that additional vegetation, i predict there'll be a real attack of weeds and once barren wastelands will be inundated with aqueous influx, wildlife will infest former wasteland, it's a horrible prospect.  
they really should think about their stupid scare tactics before they let fly.
